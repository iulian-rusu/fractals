# Fractals

![Julia](assets/julia.gif)

Small desktop app where you can explore fractals.

Fractas are rendered on the CPU using double presicion floats, which allows good zooming by 13-15 orders of magnitude. However, the performance may be poor if the fractal rule is computationally intensive.

Rendering is done on 16 threads by default.

## Controls
* W/A/S/D - move the window in the complex plane
* Arrow Keys - move the seed in the complex plane
* R - reset
* Mouse Wheel - zoom
